### Architect Prompt

"Hello, Architect. Please review the Product Requirements Document located at `docs/prd.md`. Your task is to create a technical architecture and implementation plan based on these requirements.

Pay close attention to the following:

1.  **Blocker on Epic 3:** The highest priority is to action Story 3.1 and determine if the MS4 service supports batch ingestion. The entire performance goal hinges on this. Please investigate and report back immediately.
2.  **Technical Stack:** The plan should adhere to the existing technical stack (Python, FastAPI, Redis, httpx) as outlined in the "Technical Assumptions" section.
3.  **Epic 1 & 2:** Your implementation plan should detail the tasks required to execute the stories in the first two epics, which focus on code cleanup and resilience.

I am available to clarify any requirements."
